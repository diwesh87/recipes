How to make Missi Roti

Take wheat flour and gram flour in any bowl and add salt, carom seeds, asafoetida, turmeric powder, dry fenugreek leaves and oil into it. Mix well.
With help of water knead soft dough. Cover and keep aside the dough for 20 minutes. Grease your hands with some oil and knead the dough again until smooth. Dough for making missi roti is ready. 
Place tawa over flame for heating. Make small lump (equal to the size of medium shaped guava) and make a round ball. Dust it with some dry flour. Now roll out the dough ball in 7 to 8 inch diameter  roti.
Place the rolled roti over the hot tawa and when its slightly roasted from beneath, flip the sides. When its roasted from other side as well, take it off from tawa and roast it directly over flame. Keep rotating and roast from both sides until it gets brown spots. Apply some ghee on the upper side of the roti and place it in a casserole with napkin paper or aluminium foil. Likewise prepare all rotis. 
Missi roti is ready. Serve steaming hot missi roti, with any sabzi, curd, chutney or pickle and relish eating.
